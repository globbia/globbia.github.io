Hey! I am currently a postdoc (Assegnista di Ricerca) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://disi.unibo.it/en) at Universit√† di Bologna (Bologna, Italy), working with [Fabio Zanasi](http://www.zanasi.com/fabio/#/main.html). 

Before that i was part of the [Algebra Group](http://www.math.muni.cz/~bourkej/BAS.html) in the Department for Mathematics and Statistics at [Masaryk University](https://www.math.muni.cz/english/) (Brno, CZ) working with [John Bourke](https://www.math.muni.cz/~bourkej/). 
Even before that I was a PhD student supervised by [Nicola Gambino](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/) at the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds. I defended my thesis ["Pseudomonads, Relative Monads and Strongly Finitary Notions of Multicategory"](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/30578/) in February 2022. 

Here you can find my [cv](Gabriele_Lobbia_CV.pdf) and my [Google Scholar account](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xjHu2moAAAAJ&hl=it).

My research interests are in category theory, with applications in logic, algebra and computer science. 
Usually, I work on/use low dimensional category theory (2-/3-dimensional).
I enjoy to vary the topics of my research, so far I managed to work on things like: monad theory; Gray-categories; (skew) multicategories; (skew) monoidal structures; categorical logic (2D injectivity, sketches). 

## ItaCa
I volunteer as social media manager for [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/), the Italian community of Category theorists.
